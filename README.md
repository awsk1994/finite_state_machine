# Finite State Machine

Currently, just a basic implementation.

## Example:
see machine_test.go

## Implementation

* builder pattern
* alert_machine inherits base_machine
* interface for future variations of machine
* basic abstraction for State and Event (can be expanded for future functionalities)

## Future TODO

* Project structure fix
* Add more features to Event, State
